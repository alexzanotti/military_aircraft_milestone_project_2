# Purpose
In this project, an interactive front-end site has been built. The site responds to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data and alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

The website provides information about some of the best fighter aircraft in the world. This includes providing images, facts/specifications, descriptions and in which countries they're operating within. 

With the information gathered about the fighter aircraft, the user is then able test their knowledge by completing a 12 question quiz.

The user is also able to get in touch with the administrators of the website via a contact form.

The target audience is anyone who wants to learn more about the best fighter aircraft in the world and want to test their newfound knowledge.

This website was made for the second of four milestone projects required to complete the diploma in software development program at The Code Institute.
